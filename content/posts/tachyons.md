I discovered this [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io), a CSS library, while using [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) as my blog theme. It reminds me of [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), but it seems it doesn't require an asset pipeline.

I wrote HTML and CSS when I was employed at a small company founded by a Ph.D. student during my college years. Their primary tool was [Drupal](https://drupal.org), a CMS developed in PHP. I recall struggling with frequently switching between class names and stylesheets, getting lost in different naming conventions, lengthy class names, and unexpected overrides from various modules. This experience might have played a role in steering me towards becoming a back-end engineer.

To me, the concept of utility classes popularized by tailwindcss is fascinating because it eliminates unconventional class names. Everything follows a standard convention, much like how Ruby on Rails operates.
