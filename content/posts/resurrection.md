The last post I published on my blog was in 2019, so it has been a while. A random idea struck me that I should resume my blog in 2024.

Here are my considerations:

## Choosing a Long-Standing Static Website Generator

I choose [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

Although I am fond of HTML5 and vanilla JavaScript and initially wanted to build my new blog solely with them, I face several challenges that I would have had to handle myself, such as generating an RSS feed. Hugo takes care of these for me.

By the way, I have a strong preference for single-binary, cross-platform applications. When faced with the choice between a tool written in Go or Rust and one that relies on Python or Ruby, I will undoubtedly opt for the former. This preference led me to rule out Jekyll or Pelican this time.

## Short Content

I admire [Gea-Suan Lin's BLOG](https://blog.gslin.org), where every article is concise.

We live in a busy world today. Attention has become a scarce resource, so I need to eliminate any superfluous content and get straight to the point. Moreover, if the content is compelling enough, it doesn't need to be lengthy. Lastly, this approach helps me avoid burning out on my blog: I don't have to leave a draft on the shelf for too long or hesitate to publish it.

## In English

Thanks to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). It's like the Tower of Babel for me: it helps me express myself in a common language and reach more people who don't use Traditional Chinese.

It helps in rephrasing "Chinese-English" and catching grammar errors. I nearly always learn something new from its suggestions.

There is an opinion out there that AI (or LLMs, to be precise) will deteriorate human performance in self-expression. I disagree. We are already reliant on many tools in various aspects. We donâ€™t walk or run long distances like Pheidippides did because we have cars now. I will express my thoughts on this matter in another post.

# Final

I hope to go further with my blog this time.
