I'm going to stop blogging on IPFS. Most reasons are described in a [blog post](https://neimanslab.org/2024-01-31/why-i-moved-my-blog-ipfs-to-server.html) written by Neiman.

In the last few months, the status of my blog has flipped between up and down and I have had to manually fix it, even when my IPFS node is running:

> The service shown in the screenshot is [Gatus](https://gatus.io/).

I might try [Permasite](https://permasite.g8way.io/Content/permasite.wpenginepowered.com.html) of Arweave ecosystem in the future, but for now, I will stay on GitHub Pages.
